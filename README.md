## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Required API Keys

#### Required APIs
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Get API key at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- **WeatherAPI.com**: Get API key at [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- **Google Geocoding**: Get API key at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- **RapidAPI**: Get API key at [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/) for property data
- **SendGrid**: Get API key at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/)
- **Twilio**: Get credentials at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/)

#### Note on API Requirements
All API keys are required for full functionality. The application is designed for production use and requires valid API keys to operate properly.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `python_scripts` directory:

```env
# Weather APIs
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_weatherapi_key

# Lead Generation
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key

# Communication
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

### Desktop Application (Electron)

1. **Build the React application**
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Build Electron executable**
```bash
npm run build:electron
npm run dist
```

3. **Alternative: Use PowerShell script**
```powershell
.\build-exe.ps1
```

The executable will be created in the `dist-electron` directory.

### Python Backend

The Python backend can be deployed as:
- **Standalone script** on a server
- **Docker container** (Dockerfile included)
- **Cloud function** (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)
- **Scheduled service** (cron job, Windows Task Scheduler)

## üìä Usage

### Setting Up Service Areas
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to "Service Areas"
3. Add your target geographic areas with radius
4. Configure weather alert types to monitor

### Configuring Campaigns
1. Go to "Campaign Manager"
2. Create campaigns for different weather events
3. Set target audience and messaging
4. Configure budget and duration

### Monitoring and Leads
1. The system automatically monitors weather alerts
2. Leads are generated based on weather events in service areas
3. View and manage leads in the "Leads" section
4. Track campaign performance in real-time

## üîß Development

### Frontend Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Backend Development
```bash
cd python_scripts
python setup_and_test.py  # Test all APIs and configuration
